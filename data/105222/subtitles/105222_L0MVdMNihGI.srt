Obama has a great recipe on her Twitter

28
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,399
so maybe you'd like to follow her recipe

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:06,360
this is kimchi which is pickled Chinese

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,520
cabbage advocacy a few bowls of steamed

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,299
rice which is enough around two portions

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,400
and we start adding this being there

33
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,729

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,979

35
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,409
a hot pace with a bit of sweetness to it

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,900
I'm going to put in around two

37
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,479
