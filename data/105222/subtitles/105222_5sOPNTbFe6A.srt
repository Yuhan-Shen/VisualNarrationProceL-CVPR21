3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,799
was so hungry and I decided to make

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,699
kimchi fried rice because it was one of

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:22,949
my favorite food and it is very easy to

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:26,880
make so to make kimchi fried rice I use

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:31,080
potato onion carrot and spam it is kind

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:35,570
of Pam kimchi red pepper salt 1 spoon of

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,570
oyster sauce and helps below system oil

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,980
ok we have already need to make the

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,850
kimchi fried rice then let's shut the

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:52,039
vegetables I started diced potato onion

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,949
and carrot and Haman qg in small pieces

14
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,739
at this time I put them in one plate but

15
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,199
it was not good ideas so if you are

16
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:06,000
going to make fried rice put the

17
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:10,650
ingredients in separate plate first I

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,119
added potato and carrot because they

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,689
take time to get done and why I still

20
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:23,820
frying taro and carrot I put red pepper

21
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:27,540
because I like red pepper so if you on

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:33,299
your kimchi fried rice to this more

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:40,110
spicy then put red pepper second I put

24
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:44,369
onion well you have to still fried for

25
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:49,579
about one or two minutes and why you

26
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:55,460
still frying onions they get yellow

27
00:01:49,579 --> 00:02:01,049
yellow yellow and they smell so good

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:05,729
then you put him and you put kimchi for

29
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,490
us and you surprise for one minute now

30
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,240
we are almost

31
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:16,560
then you put rice in the ingredients and

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:22,080
you put some kimchi Rickett to make the

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:25,530
rice more taste like kimchi then I added

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,200
oyster sauce 1 spoon of oil ourselves

35
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,400
don't worry too much because it gonna

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:39,330
get dirty and then I put some see same

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:42,750
way now all I have to do is still it

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:47,010
once again so all the ingredients are

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:51,870
mixed well and I put cheese on the plate

40
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:56,900
and pour the rice on the top so the

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:03:01,080
cheese are melt and it was so great

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:08,600
maybe because I was so hungry but it was

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:14,570
just so great so you should try it and

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,570
